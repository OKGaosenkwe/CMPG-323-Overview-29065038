This repository will be used throughout the academic term, by merging or linking upcoming projects' repositories with the ma. I will be applying my comprehensive knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies, utilizing various methods to incorporate these innovations. This includes selecting suitable software solutions tailored to specific problem scope and assessing the efficiency of their implementation. Furthermore, I aim to apply all the practical skills acquired during my degree program to adequately equip myself for the demands of the industry.


## PROJECT 1 - Agile & Scrum

This repository will serve as the primary, user-friendly guide for the first project, Kanban project, demonstrating the practical application of Agile & Scrum principles. It will highlight the skills acquired. The Kanban project will be used to plan and track my work throughout the semester effectively. It allows me to review all submission dates and tasks associated with each project, and how I will spend my time on training and completing projects. This will continuously be updated as I progress from one project to the next.
