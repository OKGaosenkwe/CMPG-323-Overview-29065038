# CMPG-323-Overview-29065038
This repository will be used throughout the academic term, by merging or linking upcoming projects' repositories with the ma. I will be applying my comprehensive knowledge and understanding of emerging technologies, utilizing various methods to incorporate these innovations. This includes selecting suitable software solutions tailored to specific problem scope and assessing the efficiency of their implementation. Furthermore, I aim to apply all the practical skills acquired during my degree program to adequately equip myself for the demands of the industry.


## [Project 1 - Agile & Scrum](https://github.com/OKGaosenkwe/CMPG-323-Overview-29065038.git)
This repository will serve as the primary, user-friendly guide for the first project, Kanban project, demonstrating the practical application of Agile & Scrum principles. It will highlight the skills acquired. The Kanban project will be used to plan and track my work throughout the semester effectively. It allows me to review all submission dates and tasks associated with each project, and how I will spend my time on training and completing projects. This will continuously be updated as I progress from one project to the next. 

## [Project 2 - API Development] (https://github.com/OKGaosenkwe/CMPG-323-Project-2-29065038.git)
The project 2 repository will be utilized to create a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) RESTful API. This API will establish connections with a database designed to store orders related to solar energy systems. By implementing the CRUD operations, the API will enable seamless interactions for managing the solar energy system orders, allowing users to create new orders, retrieve existing ones, update order details, and remove orders as needed. This setup will enhance the overall efficiency and functionality of handling solar energy system data.

## Project 3 - Standards & Patterns(https://github.com/OKGaosenkwe/CMPG-323-Project-3-29065038.git)
The development of a this repository will be containing an existing ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that will be enhanced and improved.

## Project 4 - Testing & PRA
In this repository, we will utilize the ASP.NET Core MVC Web Application that was previously employed in the development of Project 3. The application will undergo User Acceptance Testing (UAT), during which I will test with a designated test dataset containing input data and the corresponding desired output data. The objective of UAT is to ensure that the application functions as intended and meets the expectations of its users before its final deployment.

## Project 5 - Reporting & Monitoring
The final repository will undergo branching to the main repository and will include a comprehensive report built using Power BI.

## Context Diagram
All repositories refer back to one Kanban Guide, and are a build up of each other. You can't move on to the next project without completing the previous one.

## Branching Strategy 
Overall, the GitHub flow strategy will be used for all projects. It's used for continuous integration and frequent deployments and well suited for individual projects.

For Project 1, I will be using the Centralized workflow, where I'll be committing directly into the main branch.

For Project 2, Pattern-Based Strategy will be utilised for the API automation. The branches being, Main - Develop and Feature

In Project 3, I'll be utilizing the Forking strategy to make independent changes to it.

And for Project 4, branches are Main - Develop - Release - Feature.

## The Use of a .gitignore File Within Each Project
It will prevent unnecessary files from being tracked during development, it will also help maintain a cleaner repository. The .gitignore file will also help to avoid leakage of sensitive information such as API keys, passwords and private configuration files.

## Storage of Credentials and Sensitive Information
